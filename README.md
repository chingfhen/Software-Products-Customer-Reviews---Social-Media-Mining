# Software-Products-Customer-Reviews---Social-Media-Mining

In this project, I: 
•	Performed sentiment analysis on Amazon software reviews to achieve a high accuracy in Python and R
•	Utilized advanced machine learning techniques, and sentiment lexicons in data engineering 
•	Performed topic modelling, sentiment categorization, semantic information retrieval, feature engineering, and data visualization with R and Python

I utilised techniques such as topic modelling, contextualized embeddings, sentiment lexicons, information retrieval, and data visualization, [details](https://github.com/chingfhen/Software-Products-Customer-Reviews---Social-Media-Mining/blob/main/Report.pdf) in the report.

Additional notes:

One of the interesting insights I learnt was that the output of topic modelling (embeddings of topc2vec) can be good predictive features for predicting sentiment. Also, having a set of sentiment lexicons are extremely beneficial to the performance of sentiment models.
